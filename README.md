January 3rd, 2018 sent over appMP.js which showed the nested fucntion for the API.
January 5th, uploading to repo the Dashboard.html, appMP2.js (which has comments in green specifing where Prashant can add his code in and firebase needs to be added to it.), restaurants_icons.png, preferences.html (it's blank), login.html (it's blank).
Dashboard.html file is a good solid foundation to the over all look of the our project.  I am still working on the aesthetics.  I will tweek some colors and fonts and the Preferences to allign the nutriional numbers correctly.  If anyone knows how to do this please advise.
As of now I have just named this Dashboard "Nutritional Personalized". This can be changed later.
