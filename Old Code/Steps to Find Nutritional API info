I went to https://trackapi.nutritionix.com/docs/#/ and getting error 401 in console which means (Unauthorized)
used app id 'f60a4070'
and key 'ccfdb9db76fa612f78059d77d877a0ad'
Tried to retrieve brand id (brand id are restaurant names) thru the location search because 
I wanted to see if it would spit back brand ids back and then use those ids by going back to instant search option in the API and see if the 
filters they have listed worked as expected.  
You can pass brand id’s to the instant  search and setup different filters like sugar, carb, etc
I did this all from the web site.


Steps within website:

1) https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v2
2) clicked "Natural Language for Nutrients"
3) Scroll down to v2/search/instant
4) Click on "Expanded docs here"
5) Scroll to search instant and/or location to look for Brand Id's.
6) And found about the nutrional filters from the section in the v2 Docs labeled "How do I filter search results based on their nutrients?"
